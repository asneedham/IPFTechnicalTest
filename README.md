# Data

I've seeded some initial data in the Sqlite database, just for convenience.

The following commands were used, in Package Manager Console, to create the database and seed the data:

* Add-Migration InitialCreate
* Add-Migration SeedInitialData

* Update-Database


# Unit tests:

Apart from the unit tests for Alcohol range in Beers, other unit tests have been added for Bar controller only.  
The other controllers will be unit tested in a similar way.
